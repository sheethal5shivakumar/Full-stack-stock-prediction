# Full-Stack Application

This is a full-stack application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing user roles and sessions.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that includes features such as user authentication, role management, and session debugging. It is built using Next.js and integrates with a MongoDB database. The application is designed for administrators and users who need to manage access and roles within an organization. Key features include:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Role Management**: Assign and update user roles.
- **Session Debugging**: Tools for monitoring and debugging user sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications. It provides a robust structure for building scalable web applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user and session data. It offers flexibility and scalability for handling large datasets.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling. It allows for rapid UI development with a consistent design.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It enhances code quality and maintainability.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd full-stack-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

- **Development**: The application auto-updates as you edit the files. Use the following commands to start the server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **API Routes**: Located in `src/app/api/`, these handle server-side logic. For example, the `auth` route manages user authentication.
- **Pages**: Located in `src/app/`, these are the main entry points for the application. For example, the `login` page handles user login.

## Directory Structure

- `src/app/`: Contains the main application pages and API routes. Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific feature or page.
- `src/components/`: Reusable React components that are used across different pages.
- `src/lib/`: Utility functions and libraries that provide additional functionality.
- `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions that ensure type safety across the application.
- `public/`: Static assets such as images that are publicly accessible.
